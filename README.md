Seed dump from my discovery of cubiomes:
I have always had a love for jungles and shattered savannah biomes. After hearing about cubiomes from another user on this sub I was pumped to try it out. I created a filter (details in comments) and I ran the search until I had 10 results and then created and explored each world and narrowed it down to my favorites. I figured since I liked them all so much yall might enjoy them as well. I have flaired the post with both Java and bedrock as many of the seeds have equivalent biomes in bedrock although structures are different, I have included screenshots of bedrock maps in the appropriate folders in the Github repository, specifically for the 3 most similar seeds, 20545629, 23770330, and 73962674.

For any who are curious, I'm currently trying to decide between 29349940 & 15912656 for a (hopefully) long-term survival world with some friends.
